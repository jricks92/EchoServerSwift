CocoaAsyncSocket Example - EchoServer in Swift 3!
=================================================

## About
This project is a conversion of the EchoServer example from the official [CocoaAsyncSocket](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket) GitHub repo converted to Swift 3. I take no credit for coming up with the concept, just converting it to Swift 3. It's not an exact copy, but should be pretty close. I took the liberties to make a few adjustments as I saw fit.

## Basic Usage
1. Build & Run the app
2. Enter a Port number and click "Start"
3. Open up Terminal
4. Type "telnet localhost (port number you chose earlier)"
5. You should be connected at this point. Anything you type should be echoed back to you as well as show up in the server log window.
